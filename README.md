# My Linux Dotfiles

For the next 30 days I am going to use Linux as my fulltime desktop enviroment starting today on August 12, 2024. I have used it as a gaming/plex/network storage device for years, but I daily drive MacOS.

Noticed some conflicts with using my MacOS Dotfiles on Linux. Not everything with my ZSH config translates. So setting up a temporary repo for now.

Eventually I want to use GNUStow.
